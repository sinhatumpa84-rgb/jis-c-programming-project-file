            <li P>As per the latest budget, the income tax slabs for individual taxpayers below 60 years of age for the financial year 2025-26 are as follows:</li P>
             <li> Filing Income Tax Returns (ITR) consistently acts as reliable proof of income and builds financial credibility with banks and other financial institutions.</li>   
                <li> For both salaried and self-employed individuals, a consistent record of filing ITRs is often a mandatory document requested by lenders to assess repayment capacity for loans, including home, vehicle, and business loans.</li>
           <li> Additionally, a well-maintained ITR filing history can lead to better loan terms, such as lower interest rates and higher loan amounts, as it reflects financial discipline and stability.</li> 
           <li>Many foreign embassies and consulates require ITR filings for visa applications to verify financial stability, which can lead to a smoother and quicker visa approval process.</li>
            <li>Timely filing of ITRs helps taxpayers avoid late fees and interest on unpaid taxes, as well as legal consequences or scrutiny from the Income Tax Department. </li>
